# Building a simple madlib with Python
INTRODUCTION:

MAD LIBS is one of the world’s fun word games. Some would even call it one of the ‘GREATEST WORD GAME”. If you enjoy playing around with words, then you probably agree with this phrase.

MadLibs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story/poem/rhyme before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime(Wikipedia).

It is a game where there are neither losers or winners. A game that fills the room with laughter and creates such a relaxing environment, something every one of us needs from time to time for a healthy mental state.

In this article, I am going to share a simple way of creating this game in Python. As a beginner or expert developer, we do need that little fun. Even if you have no coding experience at the moment while reading this article, you will be able to grasp a few concepts and a basic understanding of Python Programming.

HOW IT IS PLAYED

Most often, the game has a simple sequence around it, the aim might be to form a simple poem/rhyme such as the one below, or a short story, just for fun.

“Roses are red, Violets are Blue, Sugar is sweet and So are you”
